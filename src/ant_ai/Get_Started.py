    "**Problem**: Companies struggle to identify and focus on their best-fit customers, causing wasted resources and lower conversion rates.",
    "Antematter is an AI consultancy firm that specializes in Agentic AI and Blockchain. You will be required to create a comprehensive list of ICPs for Antematter. You will identify their traits which must be sharp and not generic. You must also identify their objectives and pain-points which Antematter can potentially address.",
    "Fortune 500 Growth Specialist with over 20 years of experience in identifying sharp ICPs for SMBs and enterprises.",
